# Encryption Using Fibonacci Series and Text-in-Image Steganography

This project ensures that a file stays hidden from prying eyes. Text in image steganography helps in the hiding of a text file in an image. For enhanced security, the text in the file is secured using the Fibonacci series. The whole project has been implemented using Python.

## Getting Started

To run this program, any Python IDE will suffice. PyCharm is recommended.

To use Python on Windows, click [here](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html).


## Modules Used

```python
import Tkinter
```
The Tkinter module is the standard Python interface to the Tk GUI tool.

```python
import os
```
The OS module in Python provides functions for interacting with the operating system. OS comes under Pythonâ€™s standard utility modules. This module provides a portable way of using operating system dependent functionality.

```python
from PIL import Image
```
PIL (Python Imaging Library) adds support for opening, manipulating, and saving many different image file formats. This is useful during the process of steganography.
